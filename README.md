## History

Basketball is one of my passions and ever since I took my first steps toward Data Science, I always wondered what could I do with all that data.

> It's pronounced data, not data.

My first real NBA data analysis was done using Power BI. I used it to check the players with the best stats and make some cool dashboards to visualize it.
Of course, that's just too simple, but still, I had to begin from somewhere.

I learned how to code in Python as an evolution of the Power BI analysis. I used to download data from [Advanced Sports Analytics](https://www.advancedsportsanalytics.com/nba-raw-data)
and after a lot of data processing, use some deep statistical analysis to understand mean, median, confidence intervals, yadda yadda yadda.
Even though it was statistics textbook analysis and you could get some cool information, I was just going deep into statistic but focusing only on 
the three main statistical categories of basketball: Points, Rebounds, and Assists.

However, if you download the raw data from the website above, you'll learn at least a dozen new statistical categories of basketball.
Indeed there is a lot of data to keep you entertained for weeks, but nothing is better than getting data from the source. 



## Source

If you are a NBA statistics enthusiast you know that all roads lead to ~~Rome~~ [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/), and that may be the
best source to get raw data. Unless you are Santa Claus and will watch all NBA games on the same night all year long and get the stats yourself, who knows?

So, this project will transform this

and more, of course!



## Goals

- I will post some visual analysis on Tableau to showcase my Business Analysis skills - ~~hat number one~~

- Eventually, I will share some codes I used to get the information ready for analysis - ~~hat number two~~

- The ultimate goal is to walk you all through the whole analysis
